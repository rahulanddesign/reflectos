# 🧠🔥 Elements in the Brain and Nervous System

This table maps essential elements to their roles in brain chemistry, signaling, and mental health, merging biochemistry and neuroscience into a digestible format.

| **Element**         | **Role in Brain / Nervous System**                                            | **Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sodium (Na⁺)**     | Essential for action potentials, electrical impulses in neurons                 | Works via Na⁺/K⁺ pumps; vital for cognition and muscle control            |
| **Potassium (K⁺)**   | Works with sodium in neuronal signaling; maintains resting membrane potential   | Imbalances can cause seizures or heart issues                             |
| **Calcium (Ca²⁺)**   | Critical for neurotransmitter release at synapses; learning and memory pathways | Acts as a second messenger in many signaling cascades                     |
| **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** | Modulates NMDA receptors (important in learning); blocks calcium overactivity   | Low Mg²⁺ is linked to anxiety and depression                              |
| **Strontium (Sr²⁺)** | Not essential but can mimic calcium in bone and some neural pathways            | Sometimes used in osteoporosis drugs                                      |
| **Lithium (Li⁺)**    | Used clinically to treat bipolar disorder; mood stabilization                   | Affects serotonin and dopamine regulation                                 |
| **Copper (Cu²⁺)**    | Involved in enzymes, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmitter synthesis        | Imbalances linked to neurodegeneration (e.g., Wilson’s disease)           |
| **Zinc (Zn²⁺)**      | Found in synaptic vesicles; supports neuroplasticity and memory                 | Also modulates NMDA and GABA receptors                                    |
| **Iron (Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺)** | Oxygen transport (via hemoglobin), dopamine synthesis, and myelination          | Deficiency can impair cognition and cause fatigue                         |
| **Chloride (Cl⁻)**   | Enables GABAergic inhibition — brain’s calming mechanism                        | Helps prevent overexcitation in the brain via GABA-A receptor channels    |
