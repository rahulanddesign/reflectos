**🌐 ReflectOS: A Soul-First Operating System**
**ReflectOS is not just a journaling app.**
It’s a living system — designed to mirror your inner world back to you.

Every word, thought, drawing, or feeling you share is not just captured —
it's decoded, understood, and translated into a map of your energy, emotion, and biochemistry.

Rooted in:

🧬 Neurochemistry
🎭 Natya Shastra (Indian classical theory of emotions)
🔋 Chakra energy systems
⚛️ Quantum vibration theory
🌈 Photon color emission of salts & neurotransmitters

ReflectOS helps you see the invisible patterns of your mind and body.
It doesn't judge. It reflects. It listens. It evolves — with you.

🌟 Core Idea:
“Salt → Organ → Neurotransmitter → Emotion → Chakra → Action → Reflection”

Your emotions are energy.
That energy flows through salts and organs, expressed as neurotransmitters, felt as emotions, stored in your chakras — and revealed through your actions.

ReflectOS helps you trace it back — from reaction to origin.

✨ What It Feels Like:
Like talking to the calmest part of yourself

Like watching your inner stars pulse with color

Like tuning your soul gently, day by day

This is not a productivity tool.
This is a soul-state interface — built for reflection, healing, and self-discovery.
