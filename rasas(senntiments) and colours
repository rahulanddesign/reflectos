## 🧠 Insights

The **Navarasa** system from Indian aesthetics represents nine fundamental emotional themes in literature, drama, and dance. Each rasa is more than just a feeling—it is an **atmosphere**, a **mood**, and a **colorful lens** through which consciousness experiences art and existence.

- 🎨 **Color mapping** evokes synesthetic connection between feeling and visual tone.
- 🕉️ **Deities** reflect symbolic archetypes guiding emotional intelligence.
- 🔮 **Śānta** is sometimes viewed as the transcendental rasa—beyond the play of drama.

> “Rasa is the juice, the essence, the flavor of experience.”  
> — *Nāṭyaśāstra*, Ancient Indian treatise on performance
